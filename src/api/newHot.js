The room was spacious and came equipped with a wonderful kitchen and a large bathroom. We returned to Brussels this time to see the famous Brussels Flower Carpet in August. The MAS Aparthotel EU was a wonderful choice for us. We were able to walk to the flower carpet each day of the festival: Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and so get different views of the flowers at different times of the day. The MAS Aparthotel enabled us to have a wonderful, relaxing time in Brussels, despite all the throngs of people in the city to see the flowers.

As well as being central Brussels it is immediately next to a major metro station (Brouckere), 2 supermarkets (Carrefour & Delhaize), a kids playground and the Wolf food market. There’s surprisingly little travel noise, access via the lift is easy, there are great views and Smartflats comms on getting access were very good. Its price was quite low compared to similarly sized apartments in Brussels centre and it was well cleaned prior to our arrival. The beds were large and comfortable. You can leave bags at the very smart lounge a short walk down the street on the day of arrival and departure which is really helpful.",
          "negative": "The property isn’t being maintained very well. The bathroom was missing any blind or window meaning you can’t take a bath or shower with being seen from neighbouring properties. One of the door handles fell off. The tap on the bath didn’t work. The mirror in the toilet is missing. The light and extractor fan on the oven doesn’t work. I could go but you get the idea (other reviews suggest this isn’t unusual). I contacted the owners who fixed the door handle but nothing else (we specifically said the blind was a priority for us). The kitchen equipment is limited too, 6xknife/fork/spoon & 3 teaspoons for an apartment that sleeps up to 6, so you need to stay on top of your washing up. If you review the photos of the apartment the owners put up you’ll see the amount of chairs & tables and decide if that sufficient for you (5 dining chairs, 1 large sofa).\nOverall if you are OK with the standard it’s maintained to it’s a good base for exploring Brussels, but many people would demand better from a holiday residence. With a bit of effort this would be a 5 star apartment, but I’d be wary of booking it in future in case something even more serious was wrong and remained unfixed.",

When I came into room there was  only  17 C so it took some time to heat appartment (in particulary sleeping room). The most serious problem I had was  internet connection that was completely disfunctioning. At the end I found possibility to connect to wifi of another appartment belonging to company Smartflats. However this wifi connection was very weak and interupted for several time per evening.",

The kitchen was extremely well equipped, with cleaning products and a huge selection of crockery and glasses. The house was very clean and, once we put the heating on, it was lovely and warm. It was in a perfect location to visit the Christmas Markets and Grand Place. The car park was about a 5 minute walk from the house (you will need to drop your things off at the house first as it is on a steep hill.) The owner was happy and prompt to answer questions before we came to stay. We would highly recommend this house.",

Especially it being so late into the night too. \nAlso, please update your tea and sugar bags. The tea bags were obviously very old, the sugar itself had gotten damp inside and were clumped together. You also provide a coffee machine but no coffee capsules so either remove it or maybe offer complimentary coffee capsules too would be welcomed and appreciated. \nThe heating also didn’t work despite the instructions on the wall, but thankfully it wasn’t too cold while we stayed.

Soap in the toilet would have been nice eventually we found a dispenser in the bathroom but our initial thought was \"this place provides nothing for what it charges\". 4. A few more clarifying rules and apartment status needed. We did not consume the alcohol we bought and were confused if we are allowed to leave it behind. Since we found nothing against it we did leave it and hope someone uses it as they are all packed unopened cans. Also there was some damage on one of the window glasses which I wrote about to the property managers, I hope they had already known of it and do not try to pin it on us.",

The quality of bedding and bath towels is rather good. The kitchen has everything we need to prepare a nice breakfast. There are tram stations directly in front of the building and subway station 5 min walk away. The North Train Station is 10 min walk away. From there we took trains to Ghent and Antwerpen comfortably. There's a little Carrefour nearby, very convenient for a quick shopping ( be careful the cashier miscalculated a couple of times, always had to check the receipts).",

          "positive": "The owners and staff speak Italian and French: indeed they run a very  nice Pizzeria in the same block of buildings near to a small lake amid forests and countryside (by the way pizza 🍕 is excellent). In the same corner , at 20 meters of walking , they also owe a fully equipped and refurbished set of small apartments, that is what they rent. Apartments all have a code to dial on entrance doors, therefore no metal keys. Owner and staff are very very helpful and very friendly. Our apartment was totally renewed and refurbished , new tiles, new furniture, fridge, microwave set and the surface is larger than the average in Brussels. Bed was big and very comfortable. Driving to here is not a problem and parking is free and available on the street. The area is safe. They clean rooms every day. Now it is winter and the room was very warm and comfortable.Windows are from both sides of the apartment, so that no space remains dark (however they put curtains everywhere). Windows peeping on trees and on farms. If you send any message to the owner via Booking he will answer you at the instant  time of a flash of light rays. He is a very helpful gentleman patiently answering all our questions. Breakfast is offered inside a big basket and dropped to your room at the eve : we were two guests and found two bottles of milk, two yogourts, two packed orange juice tiny bottles, butter packed  inside blister, marmalade and jam, one apple and one tangerine and two fresh bananas and corn flakes and a big set of homemade bread and Emmenthal cheese and smoked ham . In the room they have the electric set to boil the teabags (included). They are really not stingy with the breakfast quantity and quality.",
          "negative": "I cannot find any negative point : maybe just my advice to add some metals on the walls of the bathroom (in the bathroom there is nothing to hang on towels or bathrobes ...) And I would suggest to cut the bottom part of the bathroom door of 1 cm because it grasps and scratches on the floor. But , as I said, these are minor points easy to fix one of these days",

Takes some time to get to the center by car, but this is to be expected.",

Owners acted swiftly and changed what they could. Happenings were explained by sick cleaning staff.",
